# iOS Build Note

⚠️ **Limited Functionality on iOS**

This iOS configuration is minimal and many features won't work due to Apple's sandbox restrictions:

**Won't Work on iOS:**
- ❌ File system scanning (limited access)
- ❌ Call blocking (requires CallKit, limited capabilities)
- ❌ SMS monitoring (not allowed by Apple)
- ❌ Package/app scanning (no access to other apps)
- ❌ Most security scanning features

**Will Work on iOS:**
- ✅ Web security (URL checking)
- ✅ Anti-fraud education
- ✅ Lost phone tracking (with location permission)
- ✅ Basic UI/dashboard

**Recommendation:**
QueShield is designed for **Android** where it can provide full security features. iOS version will be severely limited.

For full functionality, use the Android version.
